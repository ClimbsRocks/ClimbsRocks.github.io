Last post on N-Queens, I promise :)

One of the things that really struck me about this exercise was the glaring difference between my original code (which worked), and my final code (which worked much more quickly). 

At it's longest, my code was over 300 lines long, relying on a series of objects and helper functions and all kinds of loops, quite a few of them nested inside of 2 or even three outer loops. 

At it's simplest, the file got down to 30 some lines of code, an entire order of magnitude decrease. 

Needless to say, the final version was considerably easier to read, and several orders of magnitude quicker to run. 

It was a stark reminder that writing more code is rarely the goal. 

I'm trying to apply a philosophy of minimalism to my personal life. I've found I have so much less mental burden when I have fewer things. There's just less to take care of and remember. I feel so much more free when my life is simple and focused down on only a few core things. 

It's fun to see that at least at a high level, the same approach works with code
