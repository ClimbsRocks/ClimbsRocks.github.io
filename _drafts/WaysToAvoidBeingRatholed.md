1. Super high level- attach all knowledge as a branch to a main trunk. Elon Musk said this well in his recent AMA. If you're interested in things (I am! I'm curious! About all of the things!), limit your interest to areas you care about and want to go deeper in. 
2. Define what the problem is very specifically. 
  Not (well, I can't get this to work), but rather "There is this one specific component that is returning this thing, when I expected it to return that thing". 
3. Seek knowledge with that goal in mind. 
4. Time Bound ruthlessly. 'I have 5 minutes to find this solution' will prevent you from getting endlessly lost and diving too deep into things. 
5. investigate the interfaces of things, not their innner workings. Their inner workings take way too long. Look at what arguments it takes, and what it returns.
