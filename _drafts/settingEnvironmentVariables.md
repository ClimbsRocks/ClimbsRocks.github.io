save your private keys, tokens, secrets, etc., to your bash profile, using export
name them intelligently so you can have different keys for different situations. for example, i have one github key saved for my general CLI use, and another saved purely for making api calls on behalf of a specific application.

reload your bash profile (reprof!)

access the variables through process.env.variableName;

talk about the problems this bypasses. 
talk about my friend who kept getting calls from Amazon because he kept committing his keys.
