there seems to be an obvious opportunity to integrate React and d3. 

basically, you pass us a d3 object, and we'll handle the rest. 

what we have to do: 

1. make sure the d3 object updates when it should. 
2. make sure the d3 object doesn't update when it shouldn't. 
3. return something from Render
4. attach to the proper part of the dom
5. fit it in with the rest of the React architecture. 
6. possibly return a React component if necessary? that might make it super easy, but would remove customization.
