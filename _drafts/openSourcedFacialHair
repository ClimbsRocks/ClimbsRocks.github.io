I believe in the open source community. 

In fact, I believe in it so much, that I'm open sourcing my facial hair design for the next week. 

I've found that nothing brings people together like some ridiculous facial hair. I've met so many strangers, made so many people laugh and smile, with something as simple as only shaving off one half of my mustache. 

So now it's time to take it to the next level, and see if I can make people happy by letting them choose what to carve into the hair on my face. 

Send in any image you'd like of some ridiculous facial hair, and I will try to pull it off for a few days!

The one constraint is that it has to include a mustache. I have something in mind that I've never seen on someone's face, and I need the mustache as the raw materials to pull it off. 

Here's some inspiration from previous beards:
