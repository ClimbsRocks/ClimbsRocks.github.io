when building out an app, it's important to stay focused on the current iteration and not get distracted building out theoretical but as yet unneeded (and un-spec'd) future functionality. 

However, it's important that, where possible, you build the app to be modular enough to allow easy future development. 

One way an app can become brittle is through it's api. 

an easy way to avoid this is by creating versions of your api, even from the start. 

so, instead of making an api call to superawesomestartup.com/getAllData, you would make a call to superawesomestartup.com/1/getAllData

this way, when you create a new version of your api, you can easily switch that path to be superawesomestartup.com/2/getAllData, without breaking existing calls to v1 of your api.
